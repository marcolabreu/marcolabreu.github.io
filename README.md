# Marco Antonio Abreu's website

This my static website created with Sparkle, a web design GUI application for macOS.

## Photograph
The photograph came from Pixabay and it's in public domain.

## Icons
The icons came from different sources:
* LinkedIn icon is an SVG generated from the official LinkedIn brand EPS file
* Flickr is a vector art I created over a bitmap
* the mail icon was created by me to match the square format

## Fonts
Only two fonts in this design, both are Google's free fonts, April FatFace and Oswald.
